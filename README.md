Quadtrees are an efficient data-structure used to represent multi-dimensional spatial data. Quadtrees
come in many flavours,  one of them is used in this project, namely Point Quadtrees, to represent points on a 2-dimensional cartesian plane.
A Point Quadtree contains a point in the cartesian plane at every node. Further, a point (x0, y0)
in it has 4 children, each representing a quadrant obtained by lines x = x0 and y = y0.
